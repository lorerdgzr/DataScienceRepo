    "* Analyze existing issues\n",
    "* Reveal previously hidden opportunities\n",

    "* For **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, there are libraries like *Scikit-learn*, that contains tools for statistical modeling, *Keras*, that enables you to build Deep Learning models, *TensorFlow*, also used for deep learning, and *PyTorch*, that is used for experimentation. "
